An Apache-style access log is at /app/access.log. Parse it and write a JSON summary to
/app/report.json.

The report must be a single JSON object satisfying these success criteria:

1. "total_requests": integer, the number of non-empty log lines.
2. "unique_ips": integer, the count of distinct client IP addresses (the first
   whitespace-separated field on each line).
3. "top_path": string, the request path that appears most often across all requests
   (the path from the HTTP request line, e.g. "/index.html").

Do not modify /app/access.log.
